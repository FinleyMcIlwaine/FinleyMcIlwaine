### Hi there 👋

I'm a Haskell consultant at [@Well-Typed LLP](https://github.com/well-typed). Much of my work focuses on [optimizing Haskell applications](https://well-typed.com/blog/2023/08/reducing-haddock-memory-usage/), though I often find myself doing [other things](https://github.com/well-typed/snappy-c) as well.
